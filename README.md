 Scripts used for plotting and analyzing data for https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.12.628073v1.abstract



To generate the plots, first run `python generate_data.py` (it will take a few hours), then run the R script `plotting_scripts.R`.  The required packages are imported at the tops of each of those two scripts.  They should be generally easy to download and install, except for `fastDTWF` which must be installed as described [here](https://github.com/jeffspence/fastDTWF).
